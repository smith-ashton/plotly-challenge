# plotly-challenge
## Task:
For this project, I was given a json file of data for various samples of "the microbes that colonize human navels".<br /><br />

With this data, a dashboard was to be created using html and javascript, specifically the d3 and plotly libraries.<br /><br />

The dashboard includes a dropdown menu of each sample. When selected, all of the information obtained for that sample populates in an info box while a bar graph highlights the top 10 OCUs in the sample, and a bubble chart illustrates the sample value of each OCU within that sample.
